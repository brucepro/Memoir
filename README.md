![Image of an android writing in a journal with futuristic city out of window: Generated by Dalle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brucepro/Memoir/main/images/ai_gen_memoir.jpg)

Important: I recommend you go to the qdrant dashboard: http://localhost:6333/dashboard and create and download a snapshot of your agents vector store. This will allow you to restore in case something happens where the docker zaps it. Next release has a few features to fix this, but good to have the backup.

## Introduction

Memoir is an AI-powered plugin designed to enrich your existing AI companions within the Text Generation Web UI. With advanced memory capabilities and emotional intelligence, Memoir transforms your interactions with AI into a more nuanced and human-like experience.

## Key Features

- **Short-Term Memory:** Stores recent conversations for enhanced contextual awareness.
- **Long-Term Memory:** Utilizes a vector database for creating and recalling durable memories. (You can manage and edit entries on the qdrant dashboard: http://localhost:6333/dashboard )
- **Emotion Tracking:** Monitors and adjusts the AI's emotional responses over time.
- **Command Handling:** A modular system for executing custom commands within the AI environment. [GET_URL=url,output]
- **RAG System:** Ability to ingest urls and files. Uses langchain community loaders for supported filetypes. For .epub support you may need to install (https://github.com/jgm/pandoc)
Command Structure:

YES:

[FILE_LOAD=C:/pdfs/2402.10790.pdf]

[FILE_LOAD=C:/pdfs/] - Will use unstructured loader. Better to use the pdf loader.

[GET_URL=https://www.npr.org/sections/world/, output]

NO:

[FILE_LOAD=https://www.npr.org/sections/world/] - Have not added the logic for no file extension on urls for file loader yet, use the [GET_URL=url,output] command.

        - Prebuilt binaries come as archive files (.zip, .tar, etc.) from GitHub
    2. Unzip / unpack the binary file `qdrant.exe` into `./nondocker_qdrant`
    3. (Optional, decreases load time) Set "qdrant_on_docker" to `false` in `./memoir_config.json`
    4. (Optional) Double check that the "qdrant_address" from `./memoir_config.json` matches the
        `./nondocker_qdrant/nondocker_qdrant_config.yaml` file data and that the port `6333` is being used EVERYWHERE
    5. You're done!
